                    Some systems may also allow users to customize the 3D model by changing the furniture, paint colors, and other features to get a better sense of how the property might look when furnished.

                <p>Using a 3D property rental system can save time and resources by allowing potential tenants to virtually tour properties from anywhere, at any time. It can also provide a more immersive and interactive experience compared to traditional
                    rental listings with photos or videos. In addition, 3D property rental systems may help to reduce the number of in-person showings, which can be beneficial in situations where in-person viewings are not possible or desirable, such
                    as during a pandemic.</p>
